Intersection Engine Installation
================================

Overview
========
In general, Intersection Engine (IE) installation requires:

1. :ref:`java5` and :ref:`maven`
2. :ref:`spatial_database`
3. :ref:`geotools2.6` and :ref:`geoserver1.7.x`
4. :ref:`servicemix3.3`

Details for each of the requirements and installation instructions
are provided in the sections below.

Requirements
============

.. _java5:

Java 5
------
Because of the use of annotations and some other features Java 5 is the minimum
version supported by IE. Java  6 is of course recommended for performance reasons.

.. _maven:

Maven 2
-------
The project takes advantage of Maven for package management and building. 
It has been developed with version 2.0.9 but some earlier and further versions
should work just fine.

.. _spatial_database:

Spatial Database (Oracle 10g)
-----------------------------
Oracle 10g has been used for development, but any spatial database supported
by :ref:`geoserver1.7.x` should work. If you use Oracle, please remember to use
the `Oracle NG drivers`__.

At the minimum, the following 2 tables and summary view will need to be created
to store the results of the calculations:

.. code-block:: sql

    create table FIGIS.STATISTICAL_TABLE(
      ID number primary key,
      SRC_NAME varchar2(100),
      SRC_CODE varchar2(255),
      TOT_AREA_SRC number,
      TRG_NAME varchar2(100),
      TRG_CODE varchar2(255),
      TOT_AREA_TRG number,
      AREA number,
      OV_SRC number,
      OV_TRG number,
      CONSTRAINT statistical_pk PRIMARY KEY (ID)
    ) TABLESPACE USERS;

    create table FIGIS.SPATIAL_TABLE(
      ID number,
      THE_GEOM MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY,
      STATS number UNIQUE,
      CONSTRAINT spatial_pk PRIMARY KEY(ID),
    ) TABLESPACE USERS;

    create view FIGIS.SPATIAL_STATISTICAL(
      ID, SRC_NAME, SRC_CODE, TOT_AREA_SRC, 
      TRG_NAME, TRG_CODE, TOT_AREA_TRG, AREA, 
      OV_SRC, OV_TRG, THE_GEOM,
      CONSTRAINT pk_spatial_statistical_view PRIMARY KEY (id)
      RELY DISABLE NOVALIDATE
    ) as 
    select ST.ID, ST.SRC_NAME, ST.SRC_CODE, ST.TOT_AREA_SRC, ST.TRG_NAME, 
      ST.TRG_CODE, ST.TOT_AREA_TRG, ST.AREA, ST.OV_SRC, ST.OV_TRG, SP.THE_GEOM 
    from FIGIS.STATISTICAL_TABLE ST, FIGIS.SPATIAL_TABLE SP 
    where ST.ID = SP.STATS with check option;

.. _geotools2.6:

Geotools 2.6
------------
Geotools 2.6 is being used because WFS support is more mature.

..note::
    As of Oct 15, 2009 there is a bug in the Geotools WFS module preventing
    the correct use of the project, it has been documented and the patch and
    status can be found in the JIRA `GEOT-2756`_, that requires downloading
    geotool 2.6 sources, applying the patch and installing to the local Maven
    repo so the IE project can find the updated dependency.

.. _GEOT-2756: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOT-2756

.. _geoserver1.7.x:

Geoserver 1.7.x
---------------
Geoserver is used both to serve the layers that will be used in the calculations,
as well as to store the results in the database. The following 2 layers are required:

* ``figis:statistical`` Mapping to FIGIS.STATISTICAL_TABLE

* ``figis:spatial`` Mapping to FIGIS.SPATIAL_TABLE

.. _servicemix3.3:

ServiceMix 3.3
---------------
ServiceMix is used as the glue framework for the project, the easiest way to get
it running is by using the binary distribution and then navigating to the ``geomcompare-jbi``
directory and running

.. code-block:: bash

    mvn clean install jbi:projectDeploy

It will compile the project and load it in Service Mix, if some other container is used
(for example Tomcat) you will have to manually deploy it using the administration console.

Troubleshooting
===============

No Server running in localhost:8080
-----------------------------------
Please make sure there is a Geoserver instance up and running either in localhost
or the configured location. The library performs the reads and writes using WFS.

No statistics layers
--------------------
IE needs at least two layers available for writing via WFS: ``figis:SPATIAL_TABLE`` 
and  ``figis:STATISTICAL_TABLE`` please refer to the :ref:`geoserver1.7.x` for their
structure and other setup instructions.

Geometry not supported when writing to database
-----------------------------------------------
When full logging is enabled, Geoserver may fail to write some geometries to the
database, more details in `GEOT-2771`__.
