Intersection Engine Introduction
================================

Use Cases UML
=============

Add Combination
---------------
.. figure:: images/query1.png

* Admin logs in with name and password
* Admin select water related source layer
* Admin selects water related target layer
* Admin adds the combination of source and target layer to the list of combinations

.. note::

    The list of layers contains all actual layers published on Geoserver 
    (this implies that the intersectionserver always asks Geoserver for the actual list of layers). 
    It is up to the Admin to select only a water related layer. 
    The fact that this can lead to faulty combination(s) is considered as not to be a problem.

Delete Combination
------------------
* Admin logs in with name and password
* Admin selects combination from the list of combinations
* Admin deletes combination

Trigger Batch
-------------

Admin
~~~~~
* Admin logs in with name and password
* Admin starts batch manually

Scheduler
~~~~~~~~~
* Scheduler starts batch automatically

.. figure:: images/trigger_batch.png

* The webapplication has a fixed schedular and every week at Sunday 01:00AM the batch is started. 
* The batch can also be started via the UI of that webapplication via a button. 
* The button is reachable after having done a login into the webapplication. 
* The login is a hardcoded login account.
* The definition of the scheduler is not adjustable via the UI, it is defined in a properties or 
  xml file as being part of the application software. 
* The server needs to be restarted before in order to effectuate the new scheduler definition.

Download Intersection
---------------------
.. figure:: images/query3.png

* Neon user selects ouputmode (xml or csv)
* Neon user selects combination
* Neon user downloads combination

.. note::

    The downloaded xml and csv do not contain geometry

Derived Use Cases
-----------------

The derived usecases will not be implemented in this project. The above usecases need to be 
implemented before the derived usecases can be performed. The derived usecases are mentioned 
here to have a better understanding of the context of the above usecases.

Harmonization among area classifications as a basis to achieve application goals such as:

* Reallocation of statistical (catch) data
* Reallocation of species probability distributions
* Reference marine resource distributions
* Search and exploratory functions across integrated datab

Class Diagram Context
---------------------
.. figure:: images/diagram.jpg

Class Diagram Intersection
--------------------------
.. figure:: images/class_intersection.png

* Resulting coastline intersection percentage and polygons are cut.
* Binary intersection means an intersection between 2 layers.
* An intersection is the based on 1 source and 1 target polygon.

Artefact Diagram

.. note::

    All artefacts in the diagram are artefacts to be produced by GeoSolutions, except the GeoServer artefact.
