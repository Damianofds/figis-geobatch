The GeomCompare project currently expects a running Geoserver instance with WFS 1.0 in:

http://localhost:8080/geoserver

It has been verified to work with Geoserver 1.7.6

The resulting data is save to a couple of features with the following names ( including namespace )

figis:statistical = Maps to STATISTICAL_TABLE
figis:spatial = Maps to SPATIAL_TABLE


To run the project in Eclipse, you should also have in your workspace the latest gt-wfs project
with the following two patches attached:


WFS does not support feature types without geometry columns.
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOT-2737

Ignored Geometry attribute when writing to WFS 1.0
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOT-2756
